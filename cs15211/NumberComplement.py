# Description: Leetcode # 476. Number Complement
#
# Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
# The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
#
# Note:
# The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
# You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
# Example 1:
# Input: 5
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010.
# So you need to output 2.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: 1
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0.
# So you need to output 0.

# Thought:

for example:
100110, its complement is 011001, the sum is 111111.
So we only need get the min number large or equal to num, then do substraction

    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

            i += Math.pow(2, j);
            j++;

}
According to the problem, the result is

The flipped version of the original input but
Only flip N bits within the range from LEFTMOST bit of 1 to RIGHTMOST.
For example input = 5 (the binary representation is 101), the LEFTMOST bit of 1 is the third one from RIGHTMOST
(100, N = 3). Then we need to flip 3 bits from RIGHTMOST and the answer is 010
To achieve above algorithm, we need to do 3 steps:

Create a bit mask which has N bits of 1 from RIGHTMOST.
In above example, the mask is 111.
And we can use the decent Java built-in function Integer.highestOneBit to get the LEFTMOST bit of 1,
left shift one, and then minus one.
Please remember this wonderful trick to create bit masks with N ones at RIGHTMOST, you will be able to use it later.
Negate the whole input number.
Bit AND numbers in step 1 and 2.
Three line solution if you think one line solution is too confusing:

public class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int mask = (Integer.highestOneBit(num) << 1) - 1;
        num = ~num;
        return num & mask;
    }
}
UPDATE
As several people pointed out, we don't need to left shift 1.
That's true because the highest 1 bit will always become 0 in the Complement result.
So we don't need to take care of that bit.
