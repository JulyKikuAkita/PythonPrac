# Description: Leetcode # 343. Integer Break
#
# Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of
# at least two positive integers and maximize the product
# of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.
#
# For example, given n = 2, return 1 (2 = 1 + 1); given n = 10,
# return 36 (10 = 3 + 3 + 4).
#
# Note: you may assume that n is not less than 2.
#
# Hint:
#
# There is a simple O(n) solution to this problem.
# You may check the breaking results of n ranging from 7 to 10
# to discover the regularities.

        #  Proof.
        #  1. Let n = a1 + a2 + ... + ak, product = a1 * a2 * ... * ak
        #      - For each ai >= 4, we can always maximize the product by:
        #        ai <= 2 * (ai - 2)
        #      - For each aj >= 5, we can always maximize the product by:
        #        aj <= 3 * (aj - 3)
        #
        #     Conclusion 1:
        #      - For n >= 4, the max of the product must be in the form of
        #        3^a * 2^b, s.t. 3a + 2b = n
        #
        #  2. To maximize the product = 3^a * 2^b s.t. 3a + 2b = n
        #      - For each b >= 3, we can always maximize the product by:
        #        3^a * 2^b <= 3^(a+2) * 2^(b-3) s.t. 3(a+2) + 2(b-3) = n

        #     Conclusion 2:
        #      - For n >= 4, the max of the product must be in the form of
        #        3^Q * 2^R, 0 <= R < 3 s.t. 3Q + 2R = n

# Thought:

The first thing we should consider is : What is the max product if we break a number N into two factors?

I use a function to express this product: f=x(N-x)

When x=N/2, we get the maximum of this function. (ex:  area of square)

For convenience, say n is sufficiently large and can be broken into any smaller real positive numbers.
We now try to calculate which real number generates the largest product.
Assume we break n into (n / x) x's, then the product will be xn/x, and we want to maximize it.

Taking its derivative gives us n * xn/x-2 * (1 - ln(x)).
The derivative is positive when 0 < x < e, and equal to 0 when x = e, then becomes negative when x > e,
which indicates that the product increases as x increases, then reaches its maximum when x = e,
then starts dropping.

This reveals the fact that if n is sufficiently large and we are allowed to break n into real numbers,
the best idea is to break it into nearly all e's.
On the other hand, if n is sufficiently large and we can only break n into integers,
we should choose integers that are closer to e.
The only potential candidates are 2 and 3 since 2 < e < 3, but we will generally prefer 3 to 2. Why?

Of course, one can prove it based on the formula above, but there is a more natural way shown as follows.

6 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 3 + 3. But 2 * 2 * 2 < 3 * 3.
Therefore, if there are three 2's in the decomposition,
we can replace them by two 3's to gain a larger product.

All the analysis above assumes n is significantly large. When n is small (say n <= 10), it may contain flaws.
For instance, when n = 4, we have 2 * 2 > 3 * 1.
To fix it, we keep breaking n into 3's until n gets smaller than 10, then solve the problem by brute-force.
