'''
You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -,
you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

For example, given s = "++++", return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".

Follow up:
Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.

# The imap() function returns an iterator that calls a function on the values in the input iterators, and returns the results.
# It works like the built-in map(), except that it stops when any input iterator is exhausted (instead of inserting None values to completely consume all of the inputs).

# izip() returns an iterator that combines the elements of several iterators into tuples.
# It works like the built-in function zip(), except that it returns an iterator instead of a list.
